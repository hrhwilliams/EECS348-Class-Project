- A notes webapp
  - Calculator implemented into a website 
  - Just some random examples: https://rockcontent.com/blog/interactive-calculator-for-website/ 
  - https://www.wolframalpha.com/

- Can we program a stand-alone C++ calculator, like the basic project, then integrate it with a website?
  - Have a prompt
  - Put input into the prompt
  - Press go and it calculates result
  - Could have a history function
